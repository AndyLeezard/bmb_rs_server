# Features

- As I learn and assimilate useful features in Rust in a full-stack environment, I modulize each lesson that is ready to be executed.
- Each feature pack has a backend (`/src`) and a frontend (`/static`) folder. The frontend folder contains the dist version of the app that is already built and ready to be executed. (Vite + SWC + TS)
